Summary

New Build Using Ninja

On supported platforms,

    $ make

Configuration is in two places

    Makefiles/Makefile.PLATFORM
    conf/SYSTEM.h

Replace "PLATFORM" with the system's uname and SYSTEM with a more
generic name, e.g. Mac OS is "Darwin" according to uname but we call
it "osx", other platforms may be more consistent.

# Supported Platforms
